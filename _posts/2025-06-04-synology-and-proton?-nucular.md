When it comes to _really_ sensitive data, I only trust myself, so I just pile them
up on my Synology NAS.  
Not a big deal: it's a refurbished DS214 with 2x4TB drives in RAID1, so at
least I am able to sleep at night knowing that "two simultaneous drive failures"
are unlikely to happen.

On the other hand, [Proton Drive](https://proton.me/drive) is my personal choice
for _not-so-sensitive_ data.
You know, those files that you want to share, but really care if any third
parties could have access to.

**_Obviously_**, my NAS is not exposed to the internet, so I can access it only on
my network. So how can I get the best of both worlds?

## The missing part

Folks at Proton have nice Drive apps for Android, iOS, Windows and MacOS but it
seems that the Synology compatibility [was left in the back burner](https://protonmail.uservoice.com/forums/932839-proton-drive/suggestions/48439454-synology-nas-cloud-sync) long ago.

You can always use the native app and copy files manually. But what if you could
automate the process of syncing files between your Synology NAS and Proton Drive?

## Rclone to the rescue

[Rclone](https://rclone.org) is a command line program to manage files on
**many** cloud storage solutions. And I mean **many**. But I never thought that
Proton Drive would be one of them due to its focus on security and privacy.

As it turns out, Proton Drive [is supported](https://rclone.org/protondrive/) by
Rclone, as it is based on the Go API provided by Proton. This means that you can
use Rclone to sync files.

_Technically speaking_, this is a workaround, as Rclone will not sync changes
in real time. But as long as _Nuclear_ is not yet available, the
[_Nucular_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nth4RqqmQZ4) approach is!

## Let's get started

First of all you must enable SSH access on your Synology NAS.

> **Danger Zone**  
> While enabling SSH access is generally safe and supported, it does expose your
> NAS to potential security risks if not properly secured. Or even worse, you
> may break something.
{: .prompt-danger }

Log in into your Synology through the web interface, and then navigate to
**Control Panel â†’ Terminal & SNMP â†’ Terminal**.

Tick **Enable SSH service**, and choose a port (22, _duh_)[^1].

Once connected to you NAS via SSH you must obtain root access:

```bash
dmbuil@mynas:/$ sudo -i
Password:
root@mynas:~# 
```

> **Tip**  
> I always try to use keys when SSHing to anywhere, but not for my Synology NAS.
> To overme this, You can use the SSH option `-o IdentityAgent=none` to keep
> your SSH agent from trying to use your public key for authentication.
{: .prompt-tip }

![Enable SSH](https://res.cloudinary.com/dguibifnv/image/upload/t_crop_and_save/v1749079175/dmbuil-github-pages/rclone-ssh-1.png){: w="500"}
_Enable SSH service_

From there you will need to download the Rclone install script, set permissions,
and then install it.

```bash
wget https://rclone.org/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

> **Note**  
> The installer won't be able to install man pages, throwing the following error:  
> `mandb not found. The rclone man docs will not be installed.`  
> Do not panic: it will work fine anyway, I promise.
{: .prompt-info }

The initial setup involves getting the Auth Token from Proton.
I originally configured Rclone's Proton Drive support on my mac, but you can do
it straight from your Synology NAS as well.

```bash
rclone config
```

You will be prompted to create a new remote, so type `n` and hit Enter.

Then you will be asked to choose the storage type, type the number or just `protondrive` for Proton Drive.

```text
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n 
name> protondrive
Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
 1 / 1Fichier
   \ "fichier"
 2 / Akamai NetStorage
   \ "netstorage"
 3 / Alias for an existing remote
   \ (alias)
 # ...Many more here...#
42 / Proton Drive
   \ "protondrive"
Storage> 42
```

Most probably the config has been created in `/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`,
but you can check it with the command:

```bash
rclone config file
```

The editor installed in the terminal is VI (_tense creepy background music..._).
VI it's a powerful editor, but love it or hate it. Swallow your tears and man 
up.

You can view the config file with the command:

```bash
vi .config/rclone/rclone.conf
```

The content of the file should will have a section like this:

```toml
[protondrive]
type = protondrive
username = mycoooluser@proton.me
password = 3-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2fa = 123456
client_uid = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
client_access_token = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
client_refresh_token = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
client_salted_key_pass = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx==
```

> **Important**  
> If you update your system, you'll need to install again rclone, so having the
> config in a location that will be not overwritten will avoid all the
> configuration hassle. Or at least, make sure to copy the config file to a safe
> place.
{: .prompt-warning }

**Rclone** is configured ðŸŽ‰, so now try the following command:

```bash
rclone lsd protondrive:
```

You shoud see all the folders created in you Proton Drive storage root.
Or, if you really like to watch scrolling text on a terminal:

```bash
rclone ls protondrive:
```

Rclone[^2] will list _all the files_ you have in Protron Drive.

## The copy

For the fun syncing part, I will give only a quick examples, since there is
plenty of documentation on this.
Let's say you want to mirror some or all NAS data into PD: your command is `rclone sync`.
This command makes source and dest identical, **modifying destination only**.

From the command synopsis:

> **Sync** the source to the destination, changing the destination only. Doesn't
> transfer files that are identical on source and destination, testing by size
> and modification time or MD5SUM. Destination is updated to match source,
> including deleting files if necessary (except duplicate objects, see below).

Note that files in the destination won't be deleted if there are any errors at
any point. Duplicate objects (files with the same name, on those providers that
support it) are also not yet handled.`

> **Important**
> Rclone is prone to can cause data loss if used recklessly.
> Always test first with the `--dry-run` or the `--interactive/-i` flag:
>
> ```bash
> rclone sync protondrive:DATA/ /volume1/share/DATA --dry-run
> ```
{: .prompt-warning }

You want to mirror ALL the content of the folder DATA that's in your NAS into Proton Drive.

Find in your NAS the location of the source folder, it should be in /PATH/TO/NAME_OF_YOUR_VOLUME.
Take a look under Storage manager or give a simple:

```bash
ls / 
```

And check the volume name.
Let's say it's `/volume1/share/DATA`, to sync you shall launch:

```bash
rclone --config="/var/rclone.conf" sync /volume1/share/DATA protondrive:DATA/
```

> **Tip**  
> Synology NAS creates hidden subfolders with the name `@eaDir` in every folder,
> You can exclude them from the sync with the `--exclude` flag:
>
> ```bash
> rclone sync /volume1/share/DATA protondrive:DATA/ --exclude "@eaDir/**"
> ```
>
> This can also apply to other hidden folders that you may have, such as
> macOS' `.DS_Store`.
{: .prompt-tip }

Last but not least, we must set up a scheduled job to run the Rclone command.

- Log in to the Synology NAS.
- Navigate to DSM **Control Panel â†’ Task Scheduler**.
- Next click on the create button and then click on **Scheduled Task â†’ User-defined script**.
- Then, in the create task window, enter your task name in the general settings tab.
- Next, in the schedule tab, choose the schedule.
- Finally, on the task setting tab, paste your user-defined script.

_Command to run by the Scheduled Task_

Click <kbd>Ok</kbd> to save the task.

Don't forget to disable the SSH service once you are done[^1].

_Hope it helps!_

[^1]: And by "duh" I mean that you should only use the default port 22 as SSH
      will be disabled later on: it is a well-known port and may be targeted by
      attackers even in your local network.

[^2]: If you are not familiar with Rclone, I recommend reading the
      [Rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/docs/) to learn more about its
      features and capabilities, or if you just want the list of available
      [commands](https://rclone.org/commands/).

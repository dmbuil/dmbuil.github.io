My favourite terminal is, without heasitation, [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html).
Everytime I've switched to a new macOS, one of the first steps is always installing it. Right away.

Not only that the personalisation it offers is a delight, but also, the automatisation features to make your terminal experience a lot smoother.

I could jump in with all of those, but today I'd like to talk about one of the latest I've playing with: **Profile Triggers.**

But first, you must understand the meaning of the word [**Profile**](https://iterm2.com/documentation-preferences-profiles-general.html).

## iTerm2 Profiles: a dress for every ocasion

A [**Profile**](https://iterm2.com/documentation-preferences-profiles-general.html) on iTerm2 is a set of features that are packed up altogether, so you can easily switch to another one easily.

_Figure 1. Profile section._

You always begin with the _Default_ profile (seems legit), and as you can see on [Figure 1], which contains pre-configured features such as the terminal's colours and fonts, cursor types, bells, etc.

To add a new profile, just navigate to **Preferences â†’ Profiles**, and then click on the **+** symbol under the list of Profiles. Or you can just edit the default profile, if you want. 

You can play around for a while, there are plenty of options. But my personal recommendations are:

 - Color Presets
 - Font: Use `MesloLGS NF`, size 13. You will thank me later. 
 - Window Blurr and Transparency, something around 15 for both.

And now the juicy part: [Automations](#make-iterm2-work-for-you).

## Make iTerm2 work for you

Let's say you want to display a big red warning when going `su -`. You can do that. Indeed, whatever action that _discourages_ the use of `root` user should be welcome.

You can set up a shortcut to switch to a specific profile. Alright. But what if the change could be triggered automatically
Moreover, what if you could open a specific SSH session to a Server when switching to a profile?

This can be achieved with **Login Commands** and **Automatic Profile Switching**.

> **But wait! There's something to do before**

First you have to install **iTerm's Shell integration** on every profile (server and user) you want it to integrate with!
This is, your local machine, both for your user _and_ root and any remote server.

_Figure 2. Install Shell integration wizard._

This can be easily done just by navigating to **iTerm2 â†’ Install Shell integration** and follow the wizard. I personally recommend the default option **Download and run installer**, but if your machine has no internet access, you can do it offline.

> Any profile automation will not work unless the shell integration is installed!
{: .prompt-warning }

Back to the profiles, Loging Command is a command that will be used whenever switching into a profile manually.

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dguibifnv/image/upload/t_crop_and_save/v1694034010/dmbuil-github-pages/profile-2.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Figure 3. Login Command._

In the example, whenever I select the profile **Raspberry Pi**, iTerm will ssh into `pi.boombox`. 
On the dropdown, you may find other alternatives, such as **Custom Shell** (i.e., use `zsh` for a specific profile) or just a plain **Command**. As if iTerm was a Remote Connection Manager (Did you see the **Tags** field on [Fig. 3]? ðŸ˜‡)

I left the best for the end: **Automatic Profile Switching**.

Navigate to your **Preferences â†’ Profiles â†’ (your profile) â†’ Advanced** and have a look at **Automatic Profile Switching**.
With this setting, iTerm will switch into this profile whenever a prompt/session matches any of the strings in this section.
So if I add `boredadmin@pi.boombox`, and then _manually ssh_ into my server, iTerm will switch into my profile.
Have a look at the rule syntax; I usually just use the session prompt and it's been working like a charm.
And you can add as many rules as you want.

_Figure 4. Root rule._

I indeed have a **root** profile to remember me that I am _doing naughty things_ [Figure 4]. For this, I added the following rules to make sure that no session would go unwarned:

 - `root`
 - `root@` 

This will leave this _marvelous_ look, on a normal session:
![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dguibifnv/image/upload/t_crop_and_save/v1694035440/dmbuil-github-pages/profile-4.png){: w="600" h="400" }  
And a **root** session:  
![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dguibifnv/image/upload/t_crop_and_save/v1694035443/dmbuil-github-pages/profile-5.png){: w="600" h="400" }

So if we put **Login Commands** and **Automatic Profile Switching** on the same basket, we can connect to a server remotely as if iTerm was a connection manager (_ehem_) and leave the monotonous terminal colours.

In future posts I will cover further integrations and tricks. 

_Hope it helps!_

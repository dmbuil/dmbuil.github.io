So finally this is it!
I've been dwelling on it for quite a while now, but finally took the leap and deployed the Blog.

Not sure yet about which direction it will take; whether I will be posting useful stuff and tutorials, or anything that comes to my mind.
I can only promise that I will do my best to make good, curated content (as if this was enough, isn't it?)

Just one last thing... 

```python
print('Hello World')
```
